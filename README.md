# BTB_002_OpenCV_UI_Color_Picker

In this repository, I am going to revisit "Working With UI Elements" from Alexey Spizhevoy's book [OpenCV2 Computer Vision with Python Cookbook]("https://www.packtpub.com/product/opencv-3-computer-vision-with-python-cookbook/9781788474443"). In the project, as seen in the image below, we use OpenCV and Numpy to create a GUI-based color-picker based on adjustable trackbar values.

** Note: Project is part of the BTB (Back To The Basics) collection of projects that I've found myself doing after a stint away from coding and all things technical -- Sort of reminders to myself and a way to knock off the dust a bit before diving headfirst back into projects of my previous caliber.
