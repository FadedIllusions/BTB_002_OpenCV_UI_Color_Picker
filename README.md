In this repository, I am going to revisit "Working With UI Elements" from Alexey Spizhevoy's book [OpenCV2 Computer Vision with Python Cookbook]("https://www.packtpub.com/product/opencv-3-computer-vision-with-python-cookbook/9781788474443"). In the project, as seen in the image above, we use OpenCV and Numpy to create a GUI-based color-picker based on adjustable trackbar values.
